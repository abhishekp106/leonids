Suppose one day you were walking down the street with a brand new outfit on the way to class, when you saw a child drowning in a pond nearby. Would you hesitate to plunge into the pond, worried that you’d be late for class? No! If the child was drowning somewhere across the world, but still easily within your ability to save, would any of us hesitate to help? Certainly not. The proximity or visibility of the child makes no difference to how we respond. This has incredible yet subtle implications.

It would be a strange world if you found yourself saving a drowning child every single day. It would be an even stranger world if I told you that thousands of kids were jumping in the pond every day. And it would be incredible to hear that those children are well within our grasp to save. This is not so far from the truth.

Evidence Action’s Deworm the World Initiative provides treatment for parasitic worms to children in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the best estimates suggest that they can save a life for $500. This might be more expensive than a ruined outfit, but is this truly a compelling reason to not to save the drowning child? (Gee, thanks Peter Singer…)

This example is not meant to put anyone through guilt or shame. Instead, what this reveals is that doing the most you can for others might not involve what you think it does. Volunteering in your local community, or donating to the charities you are most familiar with (like those that run advertisements on TV, or even a contemporary social movement whose time has come) might not be the most impactful way of donating time or money. Instead, it might involve sending money halfway across the world to people you’ve never seen, and who you may never meet.

The emotional gratification you have from helping others is an admirable quality, and one that is rightly celebrated. But we need to use a different mindset to help the most people possible given the limited resources we have. To make the most impact, we need to rethink [how we do good](https://80000hours.org/), and how we think about charitable giving. These ideas have inspired the Effective Altruism movement, seeking to do the most good possible in our world.

There are lots of charities out there, but how do we which ones are the best? GiveWell is a nonprofit dedicated to finding the most effective charities by conducting research and evaluating scientific evidence to see how well charities perform on one metric - lives saved/improved per dollar spent. GiveWell was started by two former hedge funders that couldn’t find rigorous, scientific evidence on the impact charities had. Think scientific studies evaluating if a certain health intervention (like Vitamin A supplementation) improves health outcomes, and by how much. Think regular, independent evaluations on charities to see if they still make a sizable impact. Think giving the best answer to: How much impact will donating another $100 dollars to Charity X make? GiveWell almost exclusively focuses on health interventions in the poorest parts of the world, as money will go farther there than in the US where (most) basic needs are provided for (most) people. While the US is far from equal or perfect, your money can make thousands of times more of an impact in the hands of the poorest people struggling to survive on less than $1.99 a day. Over its lifetime, GiveWell has moved hundreds of millions of dollars to the world’s most effective charities.
